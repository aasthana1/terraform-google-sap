# SAP HANA Submodule

This module is handles opinionated SAP HANA configuration and deployment.

## Usage

The resources/services/activations/deletions that this module will create/trigger are:

- Create a Compute Instance that whill host SAP HANA
- Create a Static IP Adresse for the Compute Instance
- Create a 2 Persitent Disks to host SAP HANA's File systems

You can go in the [examples](../../examples) folder complete working example. However, here's an example of how to use the module in a main.tf file.

```hcl
provider "google" {
  version = "~> 2.6.0"
}

module "gcp_sap_hana" {
  source                 = "terraform-google-modules/sap/google/modules/sap_hana"
  subnetwork             = "default"
  linux_image_family     = "sles-12-sp3-sap"
  linux_image_project    = "suse-sap-cloud"
  instance_name          = "my-sap-hana-instance"
  instance_type          = "n1-highmem-16"
  disk_type              = "pd-ssd"
  project_id             = "<my_project_id>"
  region                 = "us-central1"
  service_account_email  = "<my_service_account_email>"
  boot_disk_type         = "pd-ssd"
  boot_disk_size         = 64
  autodelete_disk        = "true"
  pd_ssd_size            = 450

  sap_hana_deployment_bucket = "<my_bucket_name>/<my_bucket_folder>"
  sap_deployment_debug       = "false"

  startup_script           = "${path.root}/files/startup.sh"
  sap_hana_sid             = "D10"
  sap_hana_instance_number = 10
  sap_hana_sidadm_password = "Google123"
  sap_hana_system_password = "Google123"
  sap_hana_sidadm_uid      = 900
  sap_hana_sapsys_gid      = 900
}
```
## Requirements

Make sure you've gone through the root [Requirement Section](../../README.md#requirements)

### SAP HANA Software
 Follow instructions [here](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/sap/docs/sap-hana-deployment-guide#creating_a_cloud_storage_bucket_for_the_sap_hana_installation_files) to properly Download SAP HANA from the SAP Marketplace, and upload it to a GCS bucket.


### Configure Service Account for identifying the Compute instance
The compute instance created by this submodule will need to download SAP HANA from a GCS bucket in order install it. Follow the instructions below to ensure a successful installation:

 1. [Create a new service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts)
 2. Grant this new service account the following permissions on the bucket where you uploaded SAP HANA installation file:
    - Storage Object Viewer: `roles/storage.objectViewer`

  You may use the following gcloud command:
  `gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <project-id> --member=serviceAccount:<service-account-email> --role=roles/storage.objectViewer`

3. When configuring the module, use this newly created service account's email, to set the `service_account_email` input variable.

### Post deployment script
If you need to run a post deployment script, the script needs to be accessible via a **https:// or gs:// URl**.
The recommended way is to use a GCS Bucket in the following way.:

1. Upload the post-deployment-script to a GCS bucket.
2. Grant the following role on the bucket to the service account attached to the instance if the bucket is not in the same project as the service account:
   - Storage Object Viewer: `roles/storage.objectViewer`

 3. Set the value of the `post_deployment_script` input to the URI of the post-deployment script storage bucket object, like `gs://<bucket_name>/<script_name>`.
